# Push Notification Security Checklist

This document outlines security concerns and best practices for implementing and maintaining push notifications in web applications.

## Secure Storage of Keys and Tokens

- [ ] VAPID private keys are stored securely in Firebase Functions environment variables, not in the code

- [ ] VAPID public keys are stored in environment variables, not hardcoded in application files
- [ ] User subscription tokens are stored securely in Firestore with appropriate access rules
- [ ] Apply the principle of least privilege to all notification-related functions

## Authentication and Authorization

- [ ] Push messages are only sent to authenticated users
- [ ] Users can only send notifications to themselves (unless they're admins)
- [ ] Admin notification broadcasts require admin privileges
- [ ] Validate user identity before storing or updating notification preferences
- [ ] Implement proper validation of Firebase tokens to prevent token theft

## Data Protection

- [ ] Notification payloads don't contain sensitive information (PII, financial data, etc.)
- [ ] Ensure notification content is sanitized to prevent XSS attacks
- [ ] Avoid including authentication tokens or sensitive IDs in notification data
- [ ] Implement proper HTTPS for all notification endpoints
- [ ] Validate and sanitize all data in notification payloads

## Implementation Security

- [ ] Service workers are properly configured with secure scope settings
- [ ] Implement proper error handling for all notification-related functions
- [ ] Regular auditing of who can send notifications
- [ ] Keep dependencies and Firebase SDK up-to-date
- [ ] Follow Content Security Policy best practices for service workers

## Privacy Considerations

- [ ] Users can easily opt out of notifications
- [ ] Clear privacy policy regarding what notifications users will receive
- [ ] Respect user preferences for notification types
- [ ] Implement limits on notification frequency to prevent abuse
- [ ] Clearly communicate to users what data will be used for notifications

## Regular Maintenance

- [ ] Monitor failed deliveries and invalid tokens
- [ ] Clean up invalid/expired tokens from the database
- [ ] Periodically review notification security permissions and settings
- [ ] Audit notification sending patterns for potential abuse
- [ ] Keep the notification infrastructure updated with security patches

## Testing and Verification

- [ ] Test notification security in different browsers and devices
- [ ] Verify that unsubscribing properly removes tokens from the database
- [ ] Check for cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerabilities in notification endpoints
- [ ] Test that users can only manage their own notification settings

## User Education and Transparency

- [ ] Clearly explain to users why notifications are valuable
- [ ] Provide examples of the types of notifications they'll receive
- [ ] Ensure users understand how to manage notification settings
- [ ] Provide clear instructions for disabling notifications

This checklist should be reviewed and updated regularly as part of your application security process.
